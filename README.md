This supplementary material presents several MILP/MINLP examples, exact MINLP methodologies, and associated software tools. For completeness, we also provide the algorithms illustrating how machine learning and reinforcement learning can be integrated to enhance MINLP techniques.

The full original preprint is available at

The main text of that version included 14 algorithms; to maintain conciseness in the submitted manuscript, we have relocated 11 of them to this supplement.
